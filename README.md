# Webprint-Tampermonkey-scripts
A few JavaScript pieces I wrote to simplify my logins/options on the University of North Dakota Webprint system

To use:
 1. Download Tampermonkey (http://tampermonkey.net/) 
 2. Add scripts to Tampermonkey
 3. Edit username/password saved in script - I plan to update this to be more secure in the future.
 4. Navigate to webprint.und.edu to use!
